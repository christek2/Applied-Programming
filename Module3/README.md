# Overview

This project was very difficult for me, but enjoyable nonetheless. I had never coded in Java or Kotlin let alone in a different IDE like Android Studio. There was a lot of trial and error, but I had fun developing my first prototype for an app. I really wanted to get an introduction to this type of thing, because app development is just one of the most interesting ways to program in my mind, and it's surely one of the most popular (with its popularity spreading more and more).

This app is very simple. It is merely a random name generator, that pulls from a list of names stored in the app's files. To use it, you just toggle the switch for male or female, and then you click the "generate" button at the bottom. The name appears at the top of the screen.

The purpose for creating this app was just to learn how to develop a rudimentary app. The purpose of it being a name generator comes from a curiosity that I've had for years about how people who write books, movies, shows, etc. come up with character names. I thought it might be useful for anyone who struggles coming up with such names to get some ideas.

# Development Environment

To develop the app, I used Android Studio mostly. This was the primary tool I used to test and develop, but I also used Visual Studio Code to practice writing in Java and to test my Reader class that was crucial to the function of my app. I also used the internet for resources on how to use Android Studio and how to work Java and Kotlin. To create the csv files I used Excel.

I didn't use any libraries, really, except the common uses of java.util and list/array libraries. Most of my coding was in Java but I also used a little bit of Kotlin. I dealt a lot with the xml file for the layout and the data sheets I used were csv files.

# Future Work

* Item 1: I need to not be afraid of learning any tools or language skills that might be needed instead of trying to force an "easier" approach. All of that new knowledge contributes to my understanding of programming, so I need to just try to learn all that I can.
* Item 2: I need to keep myself from being too distracted. It's very easy to just sit back put the project down when there is something more entertining to do, but this is my education. I want to be here to learn, and I need to make the investments now.
* Item 3: Every time, I realize that I need to learn how to research better and use the sources I have better. I'm doing better, but I'm also committed to not letting myself get too complacent by constantly stretching myself to comb through the sources I find.
