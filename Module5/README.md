# Overview

This program is my first attempt at creating some sort of video game. I have never done this before, but I find myself very interested in that, so I decided to give it a try!

My game is very simple, and the the goal is to destroy all the zombies that appear on the screen. You can run around them with the arrow keys, and aim/shoot with the mouse.

The purpose of this, as I said, was to try and create my own video game because this is one of the most interesting areas of programming for me. I can see myself getting into this more, after looking through python arcade and really getting comfortable with it.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

All I used for this project was python, the arcade libraries, and the internet. VSC made it really easy to debug and edit my code as I worked.

Arcade, math, and random libraries were used. They had everything I needed to create the various elements of this simple game.

# Useful Websites
* [Python Arcade](https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/examples/index.html)
* [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)

# Future Work
* I need to be better at debugging the issues I find in my code. Sometimes I'll write something and then create an incidental error, and I tell myself that I'm going to go back to it later. Sometimes I don't, and the errors pile up, and I can't untangle the mess I've made.
* I also need to be better at planning and designing before I sit down to write my code. This makes it so much easier to edit and come back to, in the case that I want to build to it at some later date.
* Lastly, as usualy, I'm not as good as researching as I wish I was. There are a lot of resources out there that can help me, but I often find myself trying to figure these things out myself, and then I get confused, waste my time, and then end up having to return to the internet anyway.
