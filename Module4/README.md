# Overview

The software that I just built is a VERY simple code that allows the user to play a game of Scattergories.

I wanted to practice coding in C++ language, which I've never done before. I like the game Scattergories, and I figured it would be fun to make a program that would just set up the game for you. Sometimes it's a real problem trying to think of good prompts, and it can take a long time to set up the game. Now, I can just press the start button and let the program do all the heavy lifting.

# Development Environment

I just used Visual Studio Code for my IDE and terminal, and the internet was my main source of information as I researched how to accomplish this task.

I just used C++ for this task. No other libraries or languages were needed.

# Future Work

Things to improve:

- Item 1: I need to focus on reusing code better. I'm still relatively new at programming with classes, so my classes are a little underdeveloped and they don't reach their full potential, but I know that if I were to improve on that one thing my code would be much cleaner and more efficient.
- Item 2: I often find myself using while loops a lot, and I'm pretty sure there are better ways, such as function recursion. In fact, while I was writing this code, I realized that in a certain place I could just recall the function rather than set the boolean variable to false so that the loop wouldn't restart. It made me realize how much harder I work sometimes, when I really don't have to.
- Item 3: Just like I said above, I find myself working harder than I have to, because I force myself into certain ways of thinking, rather than exploring newer, more efficient methods. There are things that I've shied away from just because I tell myself that it would be too much to learn at my level. But I know that I need to be pushing myself if I'm ever going to reach the next level.
