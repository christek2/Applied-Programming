# Overview

In my endeavors to develop software, I am really focusing right now on improving my algorithmic thinking and research skills. I want to be able to break down any problem far enough that it is solvable. I want to be able to navigate the internet and other resources enough that I can independently learn the solution to new aspects of programming. These first files of code are a start to my projects.

Two files are included, one in C# and the other in Python (the two languages with which I am most familiar). They both print the phrase "Hello World!" to the console.

This software was created to help me review these coding languages, since I have taken a small break and need to refresh.

# Development Environment

I didn't need much, just one site online to remind me how to start a new C# project. 

I used C# for one, which is an object-oriented language that I started using at the beginning of 2023. I also used Python, which was the first language I started programming with at the beginning of 2022.
