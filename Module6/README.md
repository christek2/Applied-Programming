# Overview

With this project, I was hoping to learn more about R and its uses and uniquenesses. I wanted to see how helpful it can really be in analysis programming, and I think I accomplished that.

This program runs and creates a simple analytic from a dataframe that it forms from csv file. The user is able to choose which generation of pokemon to observe, and the results show the relationship between that generation's pokemon's defense and attack power.

I hoped to widen my knowledge of not just R, but of coding in general. There is a lot or me to learn, and taking the time to learn a new language certainly stretches me enough.

# Development Environment

All that I needed to make this program, other than the language and libraries, was Visual Studio Code (for my editor and terminal) and the internet (for research and development).

I used R to create this program, with the library 'dplyr'.

# Future Work

- Item 1: I need to research the principles of the language better.
- Item 2: I need to focus on making my code more like a user-friendly software: seamless, easy, informative.
- Item 3: I need to make sure that the results of my program's analysis are clear and easy to read.
