# Overview

This dataset is one that I found on kaggle. It has many different columns and rows of data, spanning 801 pokemon from the first 7 generations. I took out a few columns that I wouldn't need, and the original data is at thie address: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/pokemon?select=pokemon.csv

I was really interested in learning how to analyze data through software development, and it had been a whil since I used python. Learning to use the pandas library was very interesting and I'm glad I was able to learn this new skill.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Data Analysis Results


Q: How would this dataset of pokemon do against a BMI test? 
A: Well, only 15.48% would be considered healthy, while 21.6% are underweight and 48.31% are obese and severly obese.

Q:Which pokemon would have the largest attack to defense ratios, and which types would have the biggest ratio averages? 
A: Fighting types have the highest average, at 1.5, while steel types have the lowest, at 0.8.

Q: Which legendaries can be gendered, and how? In what generations is it most common?
A: There are only 7 that can be gendered: 4 can only be male, 2 can only be female, and 1 is likely to be either.

# Development Environment

I used mostly search engines like google, and question forums like stack overflow.

This software was developed in python, using the pandas library.

# Future Work

* Item 1: I need to plan better. I need to take time to design the software before I start writing.
* Item 2: I need to research better. Sometimes I cut corners and want to do something my own way, but taking the time to learn about a specific concept always pays off.
* Item 3: I need to work more every day and limit my distractions. When I am focused, my work is much better and done quicker.
