# Overview

I created a few functions that work with lists and with different input types. My first function asks the user to pick a number to find multiples for out of 100. It demonstrates the use of filtering and lambda functions and lists. My other function takes the user's input as a shape, and then depending on what they choose for their shape the code will caluclate the area for that particular shape. This one demonstrates the principle of pattern matching and the use of case statements.

My purpose here was to practice learning Erlang. I admit, it was difficult trying to wrap my mind around functional programming again, but I wanted to practice some of the principles by creating these functions.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

The tools I used to build my code were just Visual Studio Code and the Erlang extension and language.

This was done in Erlang only, no libraries included.

# Future Work

List of Improvements
* 1. One of the things I need to improve upon is planning. I have trouble coming up with the design for my projects completely in my head before I start, and then the deadline comes much faster than I was expecting because I had to write and then rewrite my code over and over again. 
* 2. Eliminating distraction so that I can be more focused during the time I have to work on my projects. This will make my work better and will help me be more efficient with my time.
* 3. Another thing that I have to improve on is not being afraid of sitting down and reading sources that I find on the web, even if they are long or tedious of hard to understand. This is so common in programming, and research is one of the most important parts. Especially in Erlang, a language that I never learned until now. I found that there were so few resources on Erlang online, so I wish I could have been better at reading deeper into the ones that were there.
